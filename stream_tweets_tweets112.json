I am cautious around Marvel and DC movies anymore because it seems like too much of the focus than anything else right now.

I don\u2019t really know either way, but I don\u2019t think they did that with any villains in the first two, so idk why that would be their philosophy with the third? But villain motivations were not fleshed out well in NWH, so if that got made, I guess I can see your point",
