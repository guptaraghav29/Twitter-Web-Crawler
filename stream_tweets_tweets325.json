So if you\u2019re willing to abide by the decisions of other studios as it pertains to Marvel, then casting 5\u20199\u201d John David to play Blue Marvel shouldn\u2019t bother you, since Sony cast 6\u20192\u201d Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine.  Doesn\u2019t matter, right?  It\u2019s all fiction.  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
